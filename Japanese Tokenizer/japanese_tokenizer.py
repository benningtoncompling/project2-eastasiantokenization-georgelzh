# Zak helped me with understanding of the algorithm, also he introduced me the function of readline()
# make a function of maxmatch where you pass sentence and dictionary to compare, returning sentence with a space if it matches.
# I didn't get a list at first, also I needed to remove the \n
# Sadip also told me to do with open as xx: to deal with file. because it will open and close the file automatically.
